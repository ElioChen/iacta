* Results
  Ok, looking at tests again. Now with adaptive force constant. Below, I will
  be putting only failures.

** May 11th
*** Diels-Alder
    Lot's of weird flip-flops between products and reactants?
*** HEW
    As far as I can tell, the product is only really found once. basically, we
    need more sampling.
*** KnorrPyrazole
    As usual, finds the first step well but not the ring formation. Maybe needs
    a catalyst?
*** SuzukiPMe3
    Fully and completely broken... but it appears to be a problem with
    openbabel? a bunch of * in the react jsons?

    Turns out to be a bug in openbabel, which does not detect Pd and Cl if they
    are capitalized! So it works fine !
